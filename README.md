# HomeAssistent-Custom-Media-Card
A simple media player card for Home Assistant.  The default one is missing some buttons that I feel should be front and center

I have tested this card with Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It should work fine.

Installation instructions:  (assumes you are using Studio Code Server)

First open Studio Code Server and find the WWW directory.  
Right click on WWW and create the File: music-assistant-controls.js
This will open up a blank file.  

Copy the following code into that file.
